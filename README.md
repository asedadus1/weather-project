# weather-project

I have developed a weather website using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, that takes the user ip address 
from the comuter and display current weather forecast. I used JavaScript to send requeststo the API
and parse the response data,and used HTML and CSS to display the information on the website.
I also implemented error handling to gracefully handle any issues with the API request. Overall, this project
has allowed me to gain experience in web development, API integration, and responsive design.
